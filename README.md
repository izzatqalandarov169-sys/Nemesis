<h1 align="center">AI-Driven Security Assessment</h1>
<h3 align="center">Autonomous Pentesting Agent</h3>



---

Nemesis turns any LLM into an autonomous pentester capable of assessing web
applications, APIs, and infrastructure. The agent reasons, understands
application logic, executes commands in an isolated container,
and documents every finding with the commands used.

---


---

## What It Does

Nemesis was built to give your AI everything a pentester needs to work.

**A fully equipped execution environment.**
A Docker container loaded with Linux pentesting tools  nmap, sqlmap, ffuf,
nuclei, and anything else it needs. If a tool is missing, the agent installs it.

**Custom exploitation via Python.**
The agent generates and executes Python scripts on the fly  custom payloads,
encoding tricks, protocol quirks, or any logic that off-the-shelf tools can't handle.

**Burp-level HTTP control.**
The agent sends and manipulates HTTP requests directly  headers, cookies, body,
auth tokens. Stored credentials are auto-injected via placeholders. Same power
as Burp Repeater, without the UI overhead.

**A persistent notebook.**
The agent logs what it knows about the application, maps attack paths, records
observations, flags interesting behaviors, and documents every confirmed
vulnerability  commands used, raw output, full context. Stop an engagement
and resume it days later for retest, deeper analysis, or handoff.

### Where is the real pentester?

You review. The AI hands you findings with full context notes, commands,
reproduction steps, and the reasoning that led there. You reproduce, triage,
prioritize, and report.

Your expertise stays where it matters. The grunt work runs on its own.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop + any AI client (Claude, Gemini, GPT...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Archsec-Emman/Nemesis.git
cd Nemesis
./start.sh
```

Dashboard: `http://localhost:31337`

> `./start.sh --dev`  hot reload for contributors
> `./start.sh --lan`  share across your local network (HTTPS, self-signed)
> `./start.sh --domain x.com`  public deploy with Let's Encrypt

### Launch the Agent

```bash
# Auto-detects Claude or Kimi CLI
python3 nemesis.py --assessment "target-corp"

# Force a specific model
python3 nemesis.py --assessment "target-corp" --cli claude

# No confirmation prompts
python3 nemesis.py --assessment "target-corp" --yes
```

### Define Your Scope

```
Load assessment 'target-corp' and start the pentest on https://example.com
Scope: all subdomains, authentication flows, API endpoints
Exclude: brute-force on /login
```

## Supported Models

Nemesis is model-agnostic. Any LLM with tool-calling support works.

| Client | Setup |
|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `python3 nemesis.py` (automatic) |
| **Kimi CLI** | `python3 nemesis.py` (automatic) |
| **External API** (OpenAI-compatible) | `python3 nemesis.py --base-url` |
| **Claude Desktop** | MCP config |
| **ChatGPT Desktop** | MCP config |
| **Gemini CLI** | MCP config |

The smarter the model, the deeper the engagement. Swap models without changing anything else.

## Agent Tools

| Tool | |
|------|-|
| `execute()` | Run any command in the pentesting container |
| `scan()` | nmap, gobuster, ffuf, nikto, dirb |
| `subdomain_enum()` | Subdomain discovery |
| `ssl_analysis()` | TLS/SSL audit |
| `tech_detection()` | Technology fingerprinting |
| `python_exec()` | Execute Python in the container |
| `http_request()` | HTTP client with credential auto-substitution |
| `add_card()` | Log a finding  CVSS 4.0 auto-scored |
| `credentials_add()` | Store credentials, auto-injected via `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` |

Built-in `nemesis-pentest` container (~2 GB, starts automatically). Plug in [Exegol](https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol) for 400+ tools  switchable anytime from the dashboard.
